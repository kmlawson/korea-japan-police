Aldous:
31 1946 "the durability of traditional practices, namely the use of torture to extract confessions from suspects."

32 "In the immediate prewar period the primacy of confession as a legal device was such that in most cases its extraction was seen as sufficient justification for the means employed. These ranged from persuasion to brutality. According to an American military government officer, ‘the use of third degree tactics to enforce confessions was common. In one instance...[he] saw the effects of acid being poured over the eyes of prisoners, blinding them for life’." F100

Robert Textor:
121 the chief of the CIC in 1946 in a prefecture joining my place of work, told me that his most valuable “man” whom he entrusted with his most important assignments, was a former high official in the Japanese secret police, an organization of professional terrorists whose her beautician was worldwide.

## That things are going better:

Forces of Order: Policing Modern Japan - Bayley
2 In 1988, for instance, there were approximately 220,000 police officers in Japan. Only 15 of them were discharged for misbehavior. Departmental punishments-meaning temporary suspension, reduction in pay, and formal reprimands-were given to another 97 officers.

Compared with the incidence of police misconduct in United States, this is a drop in the bucket. The New York City Police Department, which has 26,000 officers, dismissed 55 in 1988, more than three times the total for all of Japan. Even a moderate sized force like the one in Portland, Oregon, with 766 officers, in 1988, either fired or pressed into resigning three officers, almost one fifth the Japanese total.

 Brutality-unnecessary physical force-occurs sometimes in the handling of disorderly drunks, as the police themselves admit, and occasionally in the course of criminal investigations. Prompted by several cases of conventions, sometimes of capital offenses, being overturned by the Supreme Court on the grounds of involuntary confession, defense lawyers have campaigned for charges in the law regulating the detention of suspects under investigation. To the great embarrassment of the Japanese government, have taken their case to the United Nations commission on human rights."

3Another piece of evidence the discipline and the police may be as good as the official records show is that there is no movement among the public for the creation of new mechanisms of supervision and investigation of misconduct. There is already a form of civilian review outside the police. This is the human rights Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, established in 1948. There are human rights offices in every major city, +1200 volunteer counselors throughout the country. They receive complaints about violations of rights at the hand of government servants as well as private citizens. Amazing as it may seem, the number of complaints against the police brought to the human rights bureau has been falling every year. In 1987 only 50 complaints were received in all Japan.
