## The Legacy of Police Torture in the Japanese Empire

The United States of the first half of the twentieth century does not, then, belong to the relatively small number of countries where physical beating and torture in interrogations were uncommon. Though it is impossible to carry out any detailed comparison of a usually illegal and secret practice, the United Kingdom, at least the metropole of the empire, and Weimar Germany are among the only larger countries where reports of police torture were rare.[^15] The fairly constant reports of police torture found throughout the modern history of Japan up to 1945 are thus neither an example of an anomalous empire of cruelty that existed on the margins of civilization, nor can it be claimed that a late and distorted process of modernization allowed a barbarous practice to slip through the cracks, since the late modernization of Germany, which Japan is often paired with, is a fascinating example case in which police torture virtually disappears before being readopted in the 1930s with the rise of National Socialism.[^16] 

In contrast, the history of police torture in Japan is, in some ways, closer to the American story than the German one. It resembles the United States in at least three ways: 1) Up to the 1940s, police torture was widespread overall, but found in its most brutal and expansive form when carried out against targeted minorities. 2) Clear, and indeed increasingly clear from the 1930s, legal prohibitions existed against police torture, despite which the practice thrived. 3) Finally, in both the United States and in pre-war Japan, there were significant calls for reform and damning reports on the widespread practice of torture, especially in the 1930s. Of course, these similarities should not be overdrawn. Without the important differences between the two, there would be no story of American police reform efforts in Japan and Korea. Whereas police torture declined dramatically in the United States, the practice continued in Japan's colonies and metropole alike while its military police, in particular, exported their experience in brutality to every new territory occupied, earning Japan a universal reputation for limitless cruelty.[^22]

The most extensive study of the history of police torture within the Japanese metropole is still Richard Mitchell's 1992 *Janus-faced Justice: Political Criminals in Imperial Japan* which, despite the title, also compares torture and brutality towards political criminals, especially by the Special Higher Police (特別高等警察), or the Tokkō, with the similar violence carried out regular police in Japan. As Mitchell points out, supported by many specific cases, "brutality and torture were not simply a product of the arrest of many Communist suspects. Indeed, the evidence points in one direction: police officers, both regular police and Special Higher Police, had long used force to get confessions."[^17] Mitchell's work also, however, highlights the considerable variation in treatment of suspects depending on where and when they might have found themselves, the long history of demands for reform both within and outside of the halls of government, and the effective deployment of the other half of the janus-faced justice of his title: the rise of the efforts to secure recantations of political loyalty that endured, the system of *tenkō* (転向). 

Japan's 1880 Code of Criminal Instruction already banned torture outright, but more specific instructions banning the use of force or threats of force in police interrogations is not found until 1890 with the Criminal Procedure Code of 1890 (刑事訴訟法). As in the United States, however, these simple legal bans had little impact on police torture, which was widespread within Japan proper even before the increase in political repression in the 1920s.[^18] A wide range of torture techniques were employed ranging from water torture, needles under nails, crushing of fingers, thorough beatings, and sleep deprivation. Beyond the reports of torture in the press, and in court testimonies as accused suspects repudiated their own confessions, condemnations of police torture and the abuses of pre-indictment detention which facilitated its practice were made by lawyer groups, legislators, as well as many of the Home Ministers and Justice Ministers of the pre-war period.

These condemnations rarely directly used the word torture or even a vague equivalent terms such as the "third degree." Home Minister Hirata Tōsuke in 1910 and 1911 called for reprimands of those guilty of severe police misconduct. Home Ministers Nakahashi Tokugorō called for "irregularities" to be corrected and personal rights to be protected in early 1932 and only a few months later another Home Minister Yamamoto Tatsu also spoke against police abuses. Home Minister Ushio Keinosuke did the same in 1936, and emphasized the resulting erosion of public trust if police behaved poorly. Prime Minister Okada Keisuke responded to abuses by calling for strict police discipline in 1935, while Justice Ministers Ohara Naoshi in 1935, Hayashi Raisaburō in 1936 called for police to eradicate the use of force and other illegal means against suspects. Justice Minister Shiono Suehiko essentially admitted the practice when he lauded the success of new training guidelines for police interrogations and requirements that procurators inspect police stations. Others exposed the practice as well, including legislator Asahara Kenzō, who pointed to three deaths from torture in the Diet in 1929, procurator general Koyama Matsukichi, who admitted the police committed acts of beating and torture in 1927, an investigation by the Tokyo Bar Association in 1931-2 that confirmed cases of torture, and another investigation by the Imperial Bar Association in 1935.[^19] 

Japan even had its own confidential "Wickersham-style report," as Mitchell refers to it, in the form a report by a judge Kawakami Kan in February, 1938, "On the So-called Problem of Trampling on Human Rights" (所謂人権蹂躙問題について). Despite the sceptical sounding title, the report contained damning statistics on the violations of criminal procedures that had banned coercion in interrogations from 1932-1936, finding that only some 6 percent, or 23 out of 398 cases of reported torture were followed up upon by prosecutors.[^20] 

If, in the United States, African-Americans were the most likely to become victim of police torture even after the use of the "third degree" declined, in Japan, Koreans were, together with socialists, seen as particularly likely to face legal discrimination and were the target of some of the most brutal claims of torture, even within the Japanese metorpole.[^23] Open reform efforts, condemnations from leading politicians, and internal reports did little to eradicate torture within Japan, despite the rise of powerful psychological techniques of securing and maintaining converts in the form of the *tenkō* policy. This was all the more true in Japan's Korean colony, with particularly violent cases clustering around its opening years, and in the wake of the March First Movement in 1919.[^25] In fact, while his history focuses on Japan proper, Mitchell calls for research on whether the extreme brutality of Japanese police officers on the Korean peninsula may have led to a "transfer of attitudes" from the world of "rough justice" for Koreans to Japan when officers were transferred back to the metropole.[^24]

The most infamous security institution within Japan, in the colonies, and in other territories occupied by the Japanese was the military police (憲兵隊). In Korea, the military police took over control of the existing pre-colonial Korean police force, which had already been under heavy Japanese influence in the first decade of the new century, following the annexation in 1910.[^27] This system was largely replaced by a civil police system as a part of the reforms following the 1919 March First Movement. Though some officers of the military police were simply shifted into the new civilian police hierarchy the total number of military police dropped from some 8,066 in 1918 to 700 by 1922 and 666 by 1940.[^28] 

As shown in Table 1, based on the work of An Yŏng-sik, Koreans, which made up a significant proportion of the force ever since pre-colonial officers were absorbed, dropped as a proportion of the whole–excluding those with military police rank–in the aftermath of the 1919 transition, but they then remained relatively stable at or around 40% of the total number of officers up to the last date of reliable statistics in 1938. The proportion of Korean police officers may have grown somewhat in the final desperate wartime years of the colonial period, but as we shall see, the first American director of the Korean National Police, William H. Maglin, quoted the same estimate of around 40% Korean police officers at the time of the turnover. Within the ranks as well, there was relatively little expansion in the number of Korean inspectors or assistant inspectors, from around 15% in 1919 to 18% in 1938, and an overall decline in percentages of both the lower patrolman and assistant patrolman ranks and the higher superintendent rank.

The numbers of Special Higher Police officers in Korea, or the numbers of Korean officers who may have been counted among their ranks are not available. It is unlikely that this would contribute much to understanding the landscape of police violence in either Japan or Korea, however, since neither the Special Higher Police or the military police had a monopoly on brutality. In fact, in addition to the role of regular civil police, one key continuity in police torture before and after 1945 was the fact that procurators themselves joined police in the torture.[^29] As we shall see, an overemphasis on the infamous military police and the Special Higher Police was one of the key failures of the U.S. police reforms in both Korea and Japan after 1945.
