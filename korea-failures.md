## henderson in human rights in Korea:

. The post-1945 police and judiciary were thus tempted toward an even more brutal repressiveness than the more secure colonial era had usually found necessary. Yet the cloth of which the system was cut remained the old, colonial cloth, the methods also the same. Hence it was the character of the Japanese colonial system and attitude toward human rights that dominated the situation, not the old, indigenous Korean system, not the aims of the independence movement or the ideas or reforms of the incoming Americans.

The chief factor involved is that many members of the police departmetn are also members of the People's Committee, and as such, have allowed their political affiliations to influence their carrying out of their duties in the preservation of law and order.

## Betrayal of a Nation - Robinson

155 "Much could be said on the subject of torture. Many of the tricks of the medieval horror chamber were used to extract confessions. One say in Pusan during the Summer of 1946 I walked into a police station when the water treatment was being applied to a suspected pickpocket. He was writhing on the floor in agony, tied hand and foot. Acting as any American officer should under the circumstances, I arrested the torturers on the spot and preferred charges against them for misuse of police authority. The act very nearly netted me a court-martial. According to General Lerch, the matter was none of my concern. Apparently, I should have done nothing but report the matter to the proper authorities, meanwhile letting the victim suffer on and learn how American democracy - as interpreted by General Lerch - operated. "
-In October 1946 the police were combing the country for the leaders of the Taegu Riots (see next section). It was suspected that one of the leaders was hiding in a particular part of Taegu. Unable to unearth him, the police seized his aged mother. They announced that she would be held and tortured every day until her son gave himself up. Either he did not chose to do so or was not alive, for he failed to show up. A few days later the beaten and bloated body of the moodier was delivered to her home for burial."

156 "When such cases were reported to Military Government authorities, the American retort was often to the effect that this type of brutal treatment was the only thing a Korean understood. On August 1st, 1946, Colonel William Maglin, American Director of the National Police, and Colonel A. S. Champeny, Deputy Military Governor, made such a statement in my presence in rebuttal to arguments which I had presented. Such views, of course, negated everything for which the United States stood, as well as being unsound."


-164 I remember a report submitted by an American Military Government officer after making an exhaustive study of the police situation. This was well before the 1946 Fall strikes. The report was a wholesale condemnation of police activities, adequately supported by case histories. He predicted trouble in Pusan, Taegu, and Seoul where police activity had been particularly obnoxious. Among his final recommendations he suggested: 1) American police advisors in each province to whom all prisoners would have the right to appeal and who would act as police inspectors; 2) the use of the write of habeas corpus; 3) the right to defense counsel; 4) higher salaries for policemen so as to discourage graft; and 5) the establishment of a civil liberties commission to make continuous investigation of police activities throughout South Korea. Upon reading the report, General Hodge's first comment was, "This man sounds like a Communist."	
	165 However, after the Taegu Riot, even the General sensed that all was not quite as it should be in his kingdom, and the Joint Korean-American Conference was hurriedly convened to study the matter."

166 Most sessions ended up talking about the Korean police:
	-heard by conference William H. Maglin Chough and Chang, and Choi Nung Chin - head of national detective bureau
	-"real fireworks" when last came. Choi had made accusations against Chough andpolice in general via the press  - "aired his sentiments before the Conference in no uncertain terms. In so doing, he admitted the Japanese collaborationist charges and accused the police of undue brutality, corruption, and political partiality. A few days later the Korean members of the conference rose in alarm when Choi was summarily discharged from his post upon orders of Dr. Chough. … Kim Kyu Sik condemned the entire proceedings. All they had heard had been police officials telling how well they were doing their jobs, exclaimed Dr. Kim. 
	Brown said anyone could give testimony but "it was obvious to all that to appear before the Conference and give testimony against the police would be tantamount to committing suicide."
	167 -secret agreement advising Hodge to dismiss Chang
	-2/5 american delegates as well as entire Korean delegation - including moderate right - but Kim Kyu Sik added that if anyone was to blame, it was Dr. Chough not Chief Chang


1946.12.5 more decisions on subject of police - to "raise the standard of efficiency" - measures to "gradually eliminate those policemen whose actions were incompatible with the established principles of democracy…"
	instruction to "eliminate brutality and torture."

168 - removal proposals of Chough and Chang completely ignored.
	-no evidence of measures taken to eliminate policemen
	-no discernible decrease in police brutality and torture
	-police salaries remained low
	-no dismissals on basis of collaboration
    
200 "The argument about differences in policy pursued in Japan and Korea was a weak one at best to anyone who was at all familiar with the situation. The political environment of the two countries was very dissimilar. In Japan there existed and educated electorate and thousands of trained officials and technicians, including not a few truly democratic leaders - witness the liberal democratic movement in Japan in the late twenties. Moreover, the country was united geographically and was well integrated. In the case of Korea, one had a country suffering from geographical disunity and politically disintegration. The mass of people were illiterate and had access to no reliable information or system of communication. The Americans had been at loss to find public officials sufficiently well trained to assume responsibility and reliable enough to be trusted with any degree of authority. Moreover, there was no liberal tradition. Korea may have been self-governing for forty centuries - which goes back to a prehistoric era - but it certainly had never known democracy or anything even resembling it. 

305 	MG was both good and bad at provincial and local level. - largely in Korean hands by mid-1947.
	-"sadistic major in Pusan who personally supervised the torture of police prisoners"
	Richard Cronley - average american GI not exactly ambassador of goodwill "He held obvious contempt for the Koreans and everything Korean"
	306 "The first question CIC agents asked when inquiring into one's loyalty was, "Does he have any Korean friends?" My wife and I were threatened with court martial for joining a group of American newspapermen in a banquet in a Korean gaesong house.

-they dislike working with CIC
-"As the Police are, at this writing, the rulers of Korea. Almost all are 100 percent rightists, and for the most part, backers of RHEE, Syng Man and KIM, Koo, eminent politicians.
20 "Because of the fact that this office has constantly checked on their activities and their investigations in order to assure the command that justice was being done, this office became more and more a 'thorn' in the side of the Police. Gradually they have tried to steer clear of CIC and have balked at the necessity of cooperation. Unwittingly they have been aided in this by some of the American their own jobs and have assumed the role of protectors of their prodigy, the Police. This has resulted in the Police having freed themselves from the restraining influence of this office and having found themselves strong enough, with their American backing, to investigate what they choose to investigate, to let alone what they choose to let alone, to jail whom they choose, to make purges of leftists and then to build up any story of leftist plans for overthrowing the present government. In the present situation the Police have become a security threat to USAFIK, though this is not realized.

no beating, no torture
no japanese practices
policemen who beats is violating law

Interview with Bertsch, 1947.3.6
"It is quite true that the only reason that Chough (director of the national police) and Chang (chief of police in Seoul) have not been removed is on the direct orders of General Hodge. The reasons for General Hodges order to that effect are probably as follows:
-reluctance of military to admit mistake
-fact removal is demanded by communists
-they have been loyal to mil gov
-they might not be replaced by anyone better
-"The fact they are personal friends of General Lerch's."

Interview with Major Arthur E. Brandstatter, Police Bureau 1945.12.7

Argo Period: burea of police same as under Japnese under Col. Argo who did cut out peace preservation, censorship econ police
police affairs: under Arthur E. Brandstatter


Col. Champeny arrived Nov made first inspector gen of police bureau. Shortly therafter Argo left to join Nat Defense Bureau, followed by Ely.

Col. Champeny became director of Police and Brandstattter returned to old job as head of police affairs section.
	Brandstatter given job of studying and preparing plan for reorg of bureau - worked on this project number of weeks - results appeared in letter 26 Nov.

2 Recently, new man has arrived: Col Maglin - 
"I asked what effect this frequent changing of chiefs had on the personnel of the Bureau. Brandstatter said it was completely confusing to all. The American officers had generally lost interest in doing more than carrying on administration from day to day. And it has led them to another attitude regarding the overall policy of MG police work here treated below. The Koreans are entirely baffled by it all and many had given up trying to work with the Americans who could not make up their mind s [sic] what they wanted and left no one in a position long enough so that one could learn his policies.

-all in bureau agreed on national police force - despit lack of american tradition. Koreans - asked officially and otherwise - favore it as well.
"In fact B and others feel that they will institute as strong a force as the Japs had after we leave, no matter what we do not. THat and the general MG disorganization has led most US officers in the Bureau to thank [sic] there is little use doing anything constructive for the force. We have no idea that what we want and what we set up will be followed by the Koreans. They are fully 50 years behind us in thinking on justice and police powers and control. For one thing they advocate a huge, preposterous force of men. We in the US average 1.6 officers/1000 population; the Korean want some 8/1000...


3 "In chosing [sic] men for the lower ranks of the Bureau and for such jobs as instructors, investigators, etc., Brandstatter always selected those who had some police experience under the Japanese."

graft a huge problem: hard to keep instructors at the Police school - "These men complain that they have no opportunity to get out among the people and get their share of the graft."

B feels the police are the key to the entire Korean situation. ... The force will be a political tool no matter what we do. ...

I have tried to convey to them a true picture of your problems in Korea and I have made a special effort to 'elucidate' the police problem. It is just astounding how the sob sisters here feel for the Soviet criticism of the south Korean police. You and I know well enough this breed of critics and the harm that they can do."

Special Squad

136 discussion of reluctance of Korean juciciary to "convict defendants whos epolitical beliefs were the same as those of the judges. An excellent illustration is found in the case of KIM, Doo Whan and the Dai Han Min chung

special squad raided HQ of Dai Han Min Chung - found 11 badly beated men and a corpse - another beaten man died in a few days: 

All arrested by CIC - Kim only got 120 days in jail or 20,000 yen (present value of 10 cartons of American cigarettes on black market)

139 The Special Squad created a "comprehensive report on the "Pro-Japanese Issue" and its influence on contemporary Korean political life"

on the hiring of personnel



Col John E. Baird, Provost Marshal, USAFIK and Major Edward J. Lawler went to Taegu
Chief Agent Ireland of 24th CID was given 5 cases with signed confessions of murder of police
	when checking the confessions - none of them had anything to do with it...
	"it was later learned that the Korean police had used their old Japanese police methods--water treatment, pencil treatment, etc.--in order to extract confessions from anyone because of the ill feeling between the police and civilians population and also to save face. As can be very easily seen, the idea of allowing the Korean police to investigate the riot was impossible."

Memorandum for General Lerch

"All provincial governors (Korean) have a quarrel with the police system. They say they can't get police cooperation with the central controls from here. Personally, I believe it is a matter of operation or cooperation, rather than organization. Give me your thoughts on it.


# 14 April 1947 Memorandum for Hodge from Kim Kyu-sik
	note on front says "Key memo for hodge from Kim Kyu-sik"
2 "A reform in the Police Department is urgently and immediately necessary. Under the pretense of breaking the general strike, the police have arrested wholesale and have seized the opportunity for vengeance on their personal and political opponents. Police reform must of necessity be given the highest priority in our immediate work. It is absolutely requisite that the police play a neutral part always and everywhere (see Exhibit 1 attached herewith)

3 Conclusion

(1) There must be a reshuffle of the police personnel at least a few of the most notorious ones should be replaced. To the unsuspecting, the police may by [sic] attending to their duty of preserving peace and order, but the reality is quite the contrary. Where the police favors one side to the deteriment of the other, and where it interferes in political matters, it is impossible to realize democratic ideals. We can give any number of instances where the police have shut their eyes to terrorism and have connived with, if not insitgated, terrorist groups. Such state of affairs not only creates a feeling of unrest and mistrust of the M. G., bu the plans of the Coalition Committee cannot be realized. Therefore, as already recommended by teh Korean--American Joint Conference, the police personnel must be changed--at least some of the district and provincial chiefs."
