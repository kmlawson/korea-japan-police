## Creating a Democratic Police in Japan and Korea

The history of the Korean police in the early postwar period is usually told in one of two ways. The first, and least helpful, is the approach taken by official police histories or similar works in which the police force travels across time primarily as a slowly evolving administrative unit. Transformation is predominantly traced in terms of official decrees, changes in position or department titles, and reconfigurations of power hierarchies of the police.[^31] 

A second approach embeds the Korean police into the tragic course of political and social events leading up to the opening of the most violent phase of the Korean civil war in 1950.[^32] These works have left historians no doubt as to the severe oppression by the Korean National Police after 1945 as well as the close ties between the police and the emerging anti-Communist leadership forces in southern Korea. Inevitably, however, it results in an episodic approach which emphasizes the American reaction, or more often lack of reaction, to a crisis in Korean policing. Though they won't be recounted in detail here, the key events begin with the American displacement of local security forces created by people's committees with civil police forces from October 1945 to early 1946. The first serious challenge to American military government, and its approach to the police comes in fall 1946 with protests, riots, and dozens of attacks on police boxes in what is sometimes called the Autumn Harvest Uprising or the October People's Resistance.[^35] The uprising left dozens of officers dead, often tortured or killed in a brutal manner, revealing the deep animosity towards the police, in particular, and this was seen as one of the most significant motivations behind the uprising. The suppression of the uprising further exposed the torture and brutality of the police as they took revenge and extracted confessions from hundreds of suspects they apprehended.[^36] At a Joint Korean-American Conference held in the wake of the violence, one of the leading political figures present, Kim Kyu-sik, as well as head of the detective bureau Ch'oe Nŭng-chin (Choi Nung Chin), demanded a more full purge of what was seen as a brutal collaborationist police.[^37] 

U.S. military government reports and Counter-Intelligence Corps investigations also showed that both the larger and longer lasting uprising on Cheju from 1948 and the violent mutiny and uprising around Yŏsu in South Chŏlla in October, 1948 also exhibited particularly brutal targeting of police officers and supporters of the uprising were believed to be, just as in 1946, strongly motivated by hatred for a violent and corrupt police force filled with officers who had served during the Japanese colonial period.[^33] Thereafter, the police play an increasingly military role in suppressing guerillas in rural areas from 1948 on, eventually culminating in large scale round-ups and mass executions by police in the wake of the North Korean invasion. An attack and sacking of the headquarters of the Special Investigative Committee investigating collaboration during the colonial period in June, 1949 reveals how complete the police had established themselves as above the limits of law.[^34] The investigations of the SIC, which were carried out with the help of its own independent police force, also targeted colonial period police officers. As the only serious threat to the power of the police in the postwar period direct confrontation with the civil police was all but inevitable. However, instead of admonishing the police involved in the attack, President Syngman Rhee used the incident as an opportunity to reorganize and cripple the SIC.

If this, necessarily, lightning tour of the key moments involving the police in early post-colonial Korea reveals anything, it is the fact that during the period of U.S. Military Government from 1945-1948 there was both an awareness of a serious problem and a failure to resolve it before the 1948 founding of the Republic of Korea. This problem was usually articulated in two related ways: as the issue of the brutality of the police, especially in torturing suspects, and the issue of a police force composed of treasonous colonial remnants. *When it came to police reform, the problems of treason and torture were always closely tied together*. 

Attempts to create a "democratic police" in early postwar Japan have been studied in detail by Christopher Aldous. Aldous highlights the contrast between the ambitious goals of reformers to create a police, "accountable and responsive to the Japanese public" and one which could meet the security needs of an occupation that depended on indirect rule through Japanese institutions.[^38] These contradictions became apparent before the "reverse course" that backtracked on most reform policies and, indeed, Aldous shows that the police alone were an institution that were subject to a different and delayed timeline given its special importance.[^39] 

The most important example of this was the relatively late and ultimately failed implementation of a radical decentralization plan for the police carried out in March 1948, based on the idea that decentralization would both make the police more in tune with local needs and less subject to a central concentration of power that could easily support authoritarian tendencies within a fragile democratic government. Indeed, the issue of decentralization was so central to police reform efforts, bordering on obsession, and described in terms that made it seem as if no meaningful creation of a democratic police could happen without it, that it is remarkable that there was almost no debate over whether a similar system might be appropriate for Korea. This was true even around the time of the implementation of the program in Japan in early 1948 when enthusiasm was at its peak. Instead, in Korea, military governor William F. Dean found it necessary to send out a letter to all provincial governors on 26 January, 1948 reminding them that the provincial police chiefs were in fact under their authority. Instead of immediate and radical decentralization, Dean told provincial governors, confusingly, that the key to the system was "centralized control with decentralized operation."[^40]

The actual implementation of a program of decentralization in Japan was a late development in Japan. At the foundation of both police reform programs, was a recognition that, up to 1945, a police force that employed torture, general brutality, and was a powerful tool of political suppression, and that immediate steps would have be taken. When Douglas MacArthur and SCAP, which technically had authority over the occupations of both Japan and Korea, began the two military occupations in fall, 1945, there was not one police policy for Japan and another for Korea. The campaigns for the creation of a democratic police began with the exact same common set of basic tasks:

1. The Japanese military police and the Special Higher Police were the most infamous police organs, responsible for brutal torture and political suppression. Occupation authorities set out immediately to destroy both organizations and prevent its members from employment as police officers in the postwar period. Other officers would be retained to facilitate the maintenance of security without the need for a huge occupation force.
2. Purge additional individual officers known for brutality in the past and continue to prosecute or purge officers found to be guilty of police torture or other abuses of power.
3. Eliminate pre-1945 laws and ordinances which contributed to the police state, and strip police of some of the invasive social policing functions seen as extending the power of the state in private lives.
4. Introduce American policing methods through the use of police advisers to be used both in the education process and in a supervisory role connected to various policing organs.
5. Support the establishment or reform of police educational institutions for the recruitment of new police, and support other educational or propaganda initiatives to support "democratic policing" in both Japan and Korea.

The failure to carry out these steps fully, in both cases, and the failure to customize the approach for Korea's unique circumstances are central to the ongoing challenges the USAMGIK would face in southern Korea. When it came to police torture, the most important of these basic reforms were the purge, that is (1) and (2), the active supervisory role of the police advisers (4), and the educational efforts of the democratic police campaign (5). None of the pre-1945 laws that were eliminated or replaced by U.S. ordinances could do much to eliminate a practice that was already illegal, nor did they put strong limits on the pre-indictment detention that helped facilitate police abuses–something that remains an issue today in Japan.

## Purging the Police in Japan and Korea

The police purge in the early postwar period is the most important example of how the reforms carried out in Japan and Korea need to be seen together to fully understand the policy in its contemporary context. In this respect, the handling of the purge was only treated differently between the two insofar as Korea was an example of forced decolonization, in which the colonizer was stripped of all rights in its former imperial possession and repatriated. Though both the early postwar press and some of the language used to refer to the period of Japanese rule described Korea in terms of a military occupation, Korea and its people were not treated as a liberated state that might stand side by side with China, France, or even a soon to be independent Philippines.

The purging of any and all Korean police officers does not appear to have ever been considered seriously. Decolonisation was forced upon Japan, but, for better or for worse, the transition was treated by the U.S. military government as something more along the lines of a colonial handover in 1946 Philippines, in 1947 India and Pakistan, or in 1948 Burma. In none of these places the police forces which served the United States or the British empire loyally were a valuable resource, not suspects for treason trials. Nor was there a mass reckoning despite the fact that the Indian police and the Philippine Constabulary were both known for police torture.

Thus, the concept of a treasonous police officer, a "pro-Japanese" police officer guilty of having served the legitimately recognized colonial government was never recognized by the military government in Korea. Given the relatively small number of men and resources sent to Korea and Japan for the occupation, the fast establishment of indirect rule was essential, making the dismissal of all police also an option off the table. Instead, a police officer was to be judged by their actions. Brutal actions could be associated with a "Japanese way" of policing but this was not something to be assumed from colonial service. This can be seen in an official statement by military governor Gen. Archer L. Lerch on the occupation policy regarding the "pro-Japanese" police was made after the Joint Korean-American conference in October, 1946 when "Intimations were expressed that the National Police contained many pro-Japanese personnel," 

>It is hard to find a phsyically able young man of 28 or 29 or 30 years old who at least was not a member of the Japanese army. The mere fact that a man has served under the Japanese is not against him. Most of you people here had to serve under the Japanese, but did not become Japanese in thought and action. And so the people we are trying to get rid of in the police force are those who became Japanese in thought and action. And just as soon as we find a policeman who is thinking as the Japanese think and who is acting as the Japanese acted, we are getting rid of him...[^46]

Unfortunately, this statement, which appears to describe an ongoing process of selective dismissal process that was decreasingly in evidence in Korea and Japan despite the ongoing seriousness, if not growing severity, of the problem in the case of the former. The first wave of the postwar police purge came within a few weeks of the arrival of the occupation forces, and focused on the military police and the Special Higher Police. The Japanese military police was disbanded in October, 1945 but as we have already seen, the number of military police in Korea was only a fraction of the totals in the pre-1919 period.[^41] Early October also brought the suspension of 4,800 members of the Special Higher Police.[^42] Almost all prefectural police chiefs, and large numbers of superintendents, inspectors, and patrolmen amounting to some 5.7 percent of all Japanese police officers were purged in this process.

The U.S. military government claimed that there "sweeping personnel revisions" had been completed by 13 September in Seoul and other purges to follow in other major cities in southern Korea, with military government teams carrying out "reorganization" of the police whenever they entered a new area.[^47] Any officers who focused on enforcing the "peace preservation," were dismissed as well, but this may have merely been a reference to the general purge of Special Higher Police begun in Japan and mentioned above.[^48] The earliest Korean history of the Seoul metropolitan police claims that "the elimination of unjust police officers" who were incompatible with the creation of a new democratic police took place around 1 October, 1945.[^54] The new Korean national director of police Cho P'yŏng-ŏk announced on 26 October that bad police had been purged as part of one of his earliest speeches on the formation of a democratic police.[^56]

Unlike the case of Japan, where reports provide more specific figures, it is very hard to get a grasp of the exact nature of the purge in Korea. However, there were at least two differences in the way this purge was carried out. The first was that the reality on the ground was considerably different from Japan. Korean police officers had mostly abandoned their posts, with those in the Soviet occupied zone flooding south.[^43] Many of the Korean police officers with colonial experience who had deserted would return as part of the recruiting process to follow. In the south, local people's committees were also assuming, sometimes by force, control of local policing functions and incoming American soldiers in rural areas sometimes found that these committees were themselves engaging in in beatings and arbitrary imprisonment.[^44] It is thus hard to know who was in place to be formally purged when claims about this process taking place are being made. 

A far more important difference was the fact that it is likely that the "sweeping" purge of the early period may have referred, at least in part, to the action taken against Japanese officers. The early postwar newspaper *Maeil Shinbo* claimed that all Japanese police had been collectively sacked on 16 September.[^55] However, the process appears to have been much more gradual. Tsuboi Sachio, who was Commissioner of North Ch'ungch'ŏng province at Japan's surrender, writes in his memoir that he was formally dismissed only on 17 October, 1945 but that he remained on in the capacity as an advisor for some weeks.[^57] However, by mid-1946 some 14,000 Japanese police officers had been dismissed in Korea to join the mass repatriation of the Japanese population from the colony.[^45] This was the equivalent of a purge of well over half the entire police force and the vast majority of its higher ranks. This contributed to the security crisis faced by the occupation as it struggled to establish the authority of the military government.

In both Japan and Korea, this initial purge process was followed up by further dismissals as more specific accusations emerged. The purge of Special Higher Police was found to be extremely difficult since it largely affected those who happen to be in its ranks in 1945, not all those who had been in it at some point during their career. As one report put it, "Almost all policemen with ten years or more service have at some time or other served with the Special Higher Police because of the Japanese policy of frequent rotation of duties."[^49] Reports on the search for Special Higher Police hiding in various police departments and government agencies became a regular component of Counter-Intelligence Corps "Occupational Trends" reports, even as, in some cases, the same CIC was finding these former officers useful for their own purposes.[^50] 

In both Korea and Japan, the CIC investigated reports of police torture and other forms of abuse and could dismiss or arrest the police in question.[^51] There are considerably fewer mentions of the U.S. military government in Korea taking real action as part of its supervisory role in monitoring reports of violence by the Korean police. A report on public order from May, 1946 reports that, "for the first time," real punitive action was taken against officers guilty of police torture. A police torturer in Ch‘ungch‘ŏngbuk-to was convicted of torturing a suspect during interrogation, was fined, and imprisoned for six months in May, 1946. A superintendent, though it is not clear if this was the same incident, was also given six months for "condoning third-degree methods within his organization."[^30] Capt. Richard Robinson, who along with Lt. Col. Rankin Roberts compiled a report on the Korean police in the summer of 1946 on the eve of the fall uprising and was infuriated with the lack of action taken against Korean officers guilty of police torture. In his damning memoir of American military government failures claims that his intervention against one act of police torture resulted in a direct reprimand from military governor Lerch. [^52]

Just as the problem of police torture and the "pro-Japanese" police were together becoming a political crisis in the summer and fall of 1946, CIC reports from Japan were claiming that police torture was all but resolved as an issue:

>Abusing prisoners to force confessions has ceased except in rare cases which, when disclosed, result in dismissal and prosecution of the offenders. The Occupation Forces feel that the Japanese public and the police, themselves, are realizing that policemen should be public servants and not overlords.[^53]

The opposite was true in Korea. Though it does not make any direct reference to torture, the tone of a remarkably frank CIC annual report for 1947 differs significantly from those of their counterparts in Japan:

>...the Police are, at this writing, the rulers of Korea. Almost all are 100 percent rightists, and for the most part, backers of RHEE, Syng Man and KIM, Koo, eminent politicians...Because of the fact that this office has constantly checked on their activities and their investigations in order to assure the command that justice was being done, this office became more and more a 'thorn' in the side of the Police. Gradually they have tried to steer clear of CIC and have balked at the necessity of cooperation. Unwittingly they have been aided in this by some of the American their own jobs and have assumed the role of protectors of their prodigy, the Police. This has resulted in the Police having freed themselves from the restraining influence of this office and having found themselves strong enough, with their American backing, to investigate what they choose to investigate, to let alone what they choose to let alone, to jail whom they choose, to make purges of leftists and then to build up any story of leftist plans for overthrowing the present government. In the present situation the Police have become a security threat to USAFIK, though this is not realized.[^58]

This shows a CIC that both admits that its own elements are sometimes playing a protective role for the police, consistent with critical scholarship that highlights the complicity of American military government, but also shows that the power and independence of the police was also seen as counter-productive to the strategic interests of the United States. The CIC annual report for 1948 was no less dismal and again demonstrated a recognition of the very real consequences of the failure to reign in the police. It admitted that "Police suppression probably was responsible for the success of the Communist agitation on Cheju Do Island" and that one of their own informants within the communist South Korean Labor Party was "interrogated so severely...it was necessary to have him attended by a physician" despite the fact that the Korean police who carried out the torture knew the accused worked for the CIC.[^59] 

From the perspective of the occupation government, the official policy for purging the police in both Korea and Japan varied surprisingly little and in both places, police torture remained a problem into the postwar period. There is far less evidence of any significant resources or consistent commitment to follow up an initial purge with significant investigations even as the problem became, if anything, worse in Korea after the summer of 1946. In place of dismissals, however, the United States military government in Korea seems to have placed greater emphasis, perhaps because of its unwillingness to more directly threaten the power and morale of the Korean National Police, on the role of education and the ideology of creating a democratic police force.
